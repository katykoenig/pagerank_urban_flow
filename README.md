# pagerank_urban_flow

This repo includes the following files:
 * predict_urban_flow.pdf: a short paper summarizing our findings
 * tnp_pagerank.ipynb: jupyter notebook with the run code to get these findings


Notes: We initially wrote and ran our code and models in a Google Colab environment, using the packages included in the default Google Colab environment as well as the adjustText 0.7.3 package.
